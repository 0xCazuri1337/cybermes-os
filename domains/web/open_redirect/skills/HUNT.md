## open_redirect.signal.user_input_reaches_redirect_destination

**Claim.** An open redirect is only present when user-supplied input reaches the destination of a redirect without validation, as distinct from any redirect that exists.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the header? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

## open_redirect.auto.t.d5f5b70b

**Claim.** In a response to a HEAD request, the representation header fields describe the representation data that would have been enclosed in the payload body if the same request had been a GET.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the header? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

## open_redirect.auto.t.1c44b7de

**Claim.** HTTP message framing does not use the multipart boundary as an indicator of message body length, though it might be used by implementations that generate or process the payload.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — multipart: **do** send it as a multipart filename; **observe** whether the web server strips it first.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the multipart? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.

## open_redirect.auto.t.4ea28591

**Claim.** For a request message: If the request has a Content-Location header field, then the sender asserts that the payload is a representation of the resource identified by the Content-Location field-value.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.

## open_redirect.auto.t.b3cebefd

**Claim.** If the request method is GET or HEAD and the response status code is 203 (Non-Authoritative Information) , the payload is a potentially modified or enhanced representation of the target resource as provided by an intermediary.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.

## open_redirect.auto.t.1fb211f8

**Claim.** If the response has a Content-Location header field and its field-value is a reference to the same URI as the effective request URI, the payload is a representation of the resource identified by the effective request URI.

## open_redirect.auto.t.070fe9f7

**Claim.** For example, a representation in the payload of a PUT request ( Section 4.3.4 ) represents the desired state of the target resource if the request is successfully applied, whereas a representation in the payload of a POST request ( Section 4.3.3 ) represents information to be processed by the target resource.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

## open_redirect.auto.t.c9922b78

**Claim.** An origin server that allows PUT on a given target resource MUST send a 400 (Bad Request) response to a PUT request that contains a Content-Range header field ( Section 4.2 of [RFC7233] ), since the payload is likely to be partial content that has been mistakenly PUT as a full representation.

**Procedure — State-changing verification** (shapes: state_change; steps from template)

1. Capture the pre-state with a read-only request and record it.
2. Perform the single state change.
3. Read the state again THROUGH THE SAME ACCOUNT and, if a second test identity exists, through that identity too.
4. A change visible only to the actor proves write access, not a vulnerability. Cross-account visibility is what makes it one.

**Record:** pre-state, post-state (same identity), post-state (second identity) if available

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.

**Claim.** A payload within a CONNECT request message has no defined semantics; sending a payload body on a CONNECT request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — cached: **do** add a cache-buster, then repeat without; **observe** whether a cached 200 masked the real path.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the header? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Claim.** The response payload, if any, might also describe the communication options in a machine or human-readable representation.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — proxied: **do** request through the proxy/CDN; **observe** normalisation the proxy adds or strips.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the header? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat through the proxy? Compare against the ORIGIN directly if reachable — the difference is the proxy's contribution.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

## open_redirect.auto.t.7559c126

**Claim.** If no payload is desired, an origin server ought to send 204 (No Content) instead.

**Procedure — State-changing verification** (shapes: state_change; steps from template)

1. Capture the pre-state with a read-only request and record it.
2. Perform the single state change.
3. Read the state again THROUGH THE SAME ACCOUNT and, if a second test identity exists, through that identity too.
4. A change visible only to the actor proves write access, not a vulnerability. Cross-account visibility is what makes it one.

**Record:** pre-state, post-state (same identity), post-state (second identity) if available

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — cached: **do** add a cache-buster, then repeat without; **observe** whether a cached 200 masked the real path.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — warm: **do** repeat after a success; **observe** behaviour once a cached/derived artefact exists.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.

## open_redirect.auto.t.74923980

**Claim.** Since the 205 status code implies that no additional content will be provided, a server MUST NOT generate a payload in a 205 response.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.

<a id="open-redirect-validation-destination-allowlist-must-be-probed"></a>

## open_redirect.validation.destination_allowlist_must_be_probed

**Claim.** An open redirect is validated by reaching a controlled host through the parameter with the Location header captured, not by the presence of a 302 alone.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

## open_redirect.validation.proof_is_the_location_header_of_an_actual_302_not_the_presence_of_a_url_parameter

**Claim.** An open redirect is proved by a 3xx response whose Location header resolves to an attacker-controlled origin, captured with the redirect not followed; the presence of a `next`, `returnUrl` or `redirect` parameter on a request that returned 200 proves nothing.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — proxied: **do** request through the proxy/CDN; **observe** normalisation the proxy adds or strips.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: How to apply it in the field: treat this as the validation it is — a hunter must be able to state the concrete observation that demonstrates it, with a request and response in hand, before the finding is reportable.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.

## open_redirect.technique.hth_if_the_site_prompts_for_a_login

**Claim.** When a site bounces the browser to a login prompt, the redirect parameter carried in that login URL (next, retUrl) is the post-login destination the user influences, so it is the parameter to fuzz.

**Claim.** This flexibility regarding line breaks applies only to text within a representation that has been assigned a "text" media type; it does not apply to "multipart" types or HTTP elements outside the payload body (e.g., header fields).

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

Flat in the header? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Claim.** If a Location header field ( Section 7.1.2 ) is provided, the user agent MAY automatically redirect its request to the URI referenced by the Location field value, even if the specific status code is not understood.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.

## open_redirect.auto.t.57ed1a35

**Claim.** Automatic redirection needs to done with care for methods not known to be safe , as defined in Section 4.2.1 , since the user might not wish to redirect an unsafe request.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
