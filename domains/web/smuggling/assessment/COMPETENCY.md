# Methodology — Request Smuggling / HTTP Desync

> Derived from 3 verified items. Regenerate with `python -m wks.methodgen --class smuggling --apply`. Do not hand-edit: this file is a projection of the evidence, and edits are lost on the next cycle.

**Surface.** Front-end and back-end disagree about where one request ends, so one request becomes two.

## Preconditions

_No verified prerequisite items yet._ Derived from evidence only, so this section is empty rather than plausible.


## 1. Reconnaissance signals

_What to look for while mapping the surface, and where each signal tells you the rest of the procedure is worth running._

**Requests to appliance administrative asset paths act as an early reconnaissance fingerprint for exploitation, and the repetition of an otherwise mundane static-path request from changing infrastructure is itself the signal.**

Exploitation of edge appliances commonly begins with a request for a static administrative asset path that a normal client would not fetch. Because the request is a plain GET for a file, filtering and rate limiting rarely treat it as hostile, which is precisely why it survives to the vulnerable handler. Two properties make it useful to a defender: the path is predictable enough to hunt for in logs, and an attacker probing from rotating infrastructure produces a scattered request pattern for one static path, which is anomalous even though each individual request is unremarkable.

- *Disproof:* If the appliance never served that asset path, or the same requests occur steadily from stable client infrastructure with no subsequent exploitation, the traffic is ordinary client behaviour.

## 2. False-positive rejection

_The checks that eliminate the most common non-findings. Run these BEFORE reporting, not after a rejection._

**A roughly 1KB HTML file that downloads an image polyglot and reconstructs an XOR-obfuscated payload in the browser is HTML smuggling, not HTTP request smuggling; smuggling requires two HTTP parsers to disagree on message boundaries.**

The observation is a tiny HTML attachment that appears inert to mail and web filters, contains an encoded blob, and reconstructs a payload client-side, which is filed under smuggling because the payload crosses a boundary unseen by the filter. It is a different class. HTML smuggling operates entirely inside one browser and one origin: the sender hid the payload inside image polyglots, called the PNG or GIF files from remote so the HTML stays small, and added dynamic XOR encryption to the payloads hidden inside the image. No intermediary parses two conflicting request framings. HTTP request smuggling is a disagreement between a front-end and back-end HTTP parser over where one request ends and the next begins; a real instance looks like a server whose REST parser incorrectly handles pipelined HTTP requests, which allows successive requests to overwrite the previously parsed HTTP method, URL and body, and is filed as inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests (CWE-444). The distinguishing test is where the payload boundary is drawn: for HTML smuggling, one request and one response, and the payload materializes in the DOM; for smuggling, two requests where the victim's request is prefixed to or swallowed by the attacker's. Classify on the parser disagreement, not on the payload being hidden.

- *Disproof:* A replayed pair of requests with conflicting Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding framing makes the back-end serve the second request under the first request's connection, showing two HTTP parsers disagreeing rather than a single client-side reconstruction.

**Reject a smuggling finding until it is distinguished from the adjacent behaviour this class also covers. "Requests to appliance administrative asset paths act as an early reconnaissance fingerprint for exploitation, and the repetition of an otherwise mundane static-path request from changing infrastructure is itself the signal." and "It basically enables you to hide a payload in plain sight." share a surface and a symptom, so a response that matches the first is not evidence for it while the second remains possible.**

Hypothesis under test: Requests to appliance administrative asset paths act as an early reconnaissance fingerprint for exploitation, and the repetition of an otherwise mundane static-path request from changing infrastructure is itself the signal.

Adjacent behaviour that produces the same observable result: It basically enables you to hide a payload in plain sight.

Why this is worth checking before reporting: both are recorded in this class as gated knowledge, so a tester who stops at the first match will report one of them. The two differ in what the server actually did with the input, and that difference is observable in the response rather than in the request.

Required before treating this as a finding: capture the response that demonstrates the first behaviour specifically, and confirm the second is not what was observed.

- *Disproof:* This rule is wrong if a controlled test shows the two behaviours can never co-occur on the same surface, or if the corpus entry for "It basically enables you to hide a payload in plain sight." is out of date. In that case this class needs its false-positive guidance rewritten rather than deleted.

## Known bypasses

_No verified bypass items yet._ Derived from evidence only, so this section is empty rather than plausible.


## Chaining

_No verified chain_link items yet._ Derived from evidence only, so this section is empty rather than plausible.


## Impact

_No verified impact items yet._ Derived from evidence only, so this section is empty rather than plausible.


## Coverage gap

These stages have no verified evidence and are therefore absent above: Preconditions, Test sequence, Validation, Known bypasses, Chaining, Impact.
A procedure with a missing validation stage is not safe to act on — it produces findings rather than proofs.
