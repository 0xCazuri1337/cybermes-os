## xss.test.execution.confirm_in_real_browser

**Claim.** A payload only counts as XSS once a real browser parses the delivered page and the injected JavaScript actually runs; a payload visible in Repeater's response pane is unexecuted source text, not a finding.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — proxied: **do** request through the proxy/CDN; **observe** normalisation the proxy adds or strips.
- **WHAT transformation sits between you and the sink?** — url: **do** send it percent-encoded once; **observe** whether the decode happens before or after validation.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — cookie: **do** send it in a cookie; **observe** server-side cookie reconstruction.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — post_write: **do** trigger after a legitimate write; **observe** a stored value re-read on a later request.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

You are at the `url` rung. Continue the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the cookie? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat through the proxy? Compare against the ORIGIN directly if reachable — the difference is the proxy's contribution.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Filesystem sink confirmation* — Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.

<a id="xss-test-entrypoints-unique-alnum-marker-sweep"></a>

## xss.test.entrypoints.unique_alnum_marker_sweep

**Claim.** A short unique alphanumeric marker echoed verbatim in the response, from every request-controlled entry point tested one at a time, is the pass condition that proves reflection exists before any payload is chosen.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, encoding_ladder, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — cached: **do** add a cache-buster, then repeat without; **observe** whether a cached 200 masked the real path.
- **WHAT transformation sits between you and the sink?** — url: **do** send it percent-encoded once; **observe** whether the decode happens before or after validation.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — query: **do** send it in the query string; **observe** URL-decoded value as the app reconstructs it.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — post_write: **do** trigger after a legitimate write; **observe** a stored value re-read on a later request.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

You are at the `url` rung. Continue the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the query? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

<a id="xss-test-stored-two-identity-entry-to-exit-point-link"></a>

## xss.test.stored.two_identity_entry_to_exit_point_link

**Claim.** Stored XSS is proven only by storing a payload as one identity and loading the exit point as a second identity, because your own session re-rendering your own input proves storage and reflection, never cross-user execution.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, state_change, race_condition, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — query: **do** send it in the query string; **observe** URL-decoded value as the app reconstructs it.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — post_write: **do** trigger after a legitimate write; **observe** a stored value re-read on a later request.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the query? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Filesystem sink confirmation* — Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
- *State-changing verification* — Capture the pre-state with a read-only request and record it.
- *Race / TOCTOU attempt* — Identify the check and the use as TWO separate operations, and measure the gap between them.
- *Blind / out-of-band confirmation* — Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.

<a id="xss-test-context-determine-injection-context"></a>

## xss.test.context.determine_injection_context

**Claim.** Reading the characters immediately before and after each reflection point tells you which of the six XSS contexts you are in, and the context selects the payload family, so no payload should be tried before the context is named.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder, filesystem_sink, race_condition; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-test-bypass-parens-free-and-template-literal-probes"></a>

## xss.test.bypass.parens_free_and_template_literal_probes

**Claim.** When a filter blocks parentheses you switch to a parentheses-free invocation, and when the reflection lands inside backticks you use ${...} with no terminator at all - both are determined by what step 1 showed you in the response.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.

<a id="xss-technique-dom-source-to-execution-sink"></a>

## xss.technique.dom.source_to_execution_sink

**Claim.** DOM-based XSS exists only where an attacker-controllable source reaches a sink that supports dynamic code execution.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, race_condition; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — query: **do** send it in the query string; **observe** URL-decoded value as the app reconstructs it.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — warm: **do** repeat after a success; **observe** behaviour once a cached/derived artefact exists.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the query? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-technique-dangling-markup-exfiltrates-without-script-execution"></a>

## xss.technique.dangling_markup.exfiltrates_without_script_execution

**Claim.** An injected unclosed attribute makes the browser send the rest of the response to an attacker URL, achieving data capture with no script execution.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-validation-self-fired-marker-is-not-a-reportable-finding"></a>

## xss.validation.self_fired_marker_is_not_a_reportable_finding

**Claim.** A payload that fires an alert only in the hunter's own browser demonstrates script execution but not a reportable vulnerability, because impact requires the payload to reach another user's session or a reachable victim path.

**Procedure — item-authored procedure** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from item)

1. Separate your PoC into two observations.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — state: **do** read the state back; **observe** the change visible to a second identity.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-technique-js-string-break-out-and-repair-syntax"></a>

## xss.technique.js_string.break_out_and_repair_syntax

**Claim.** Inside a quoted JavaScript string literal the payload must both escape the string delimiter and repair the trailing script, because any syntax error prevents execution.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-technique-js-string-unescaped-backslash-defeats-quote-escaping"></a>

## xss.technique.js_string.unescaped_backslash_defeats_quote_escaping

**Claim.** An application that backslash-escapes quotes without escaping the backslash itself is bypassed by prefixing the payload with its own backslash.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-bypass-csp-nonce-hash-or-strict-dynamic-gap"></a>

## xss.bypass.csp_nonce_hash_or_strict_dynamic_gap

**Claim.** A CSP only blocks inline or foreign script execution; nonces, hashes and strict-dynamic decide whether an injected payload can still run.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the header? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-test-reject-a-dom-or-reflected-xss-candidate-when-the"></a>

## xss.test.reject_a_dom_or_reflected_xss_candidate_when_the

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Why it looks vulnerable: the markup injection is real - your marker sits unencoded in an HTML-executing context - so the defect is genuine even when nothing happens when the victim clicks.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

<a id="xss-test-reject-a-sanitizer-bypass-xss-claim-when-the-ren"></a>

## xss.test.reject_a_sanitizer_bypass_xss_claim_when_the_ren

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: If the sanitizer stripped the element, event handler or javascript: URL, the surviving characters are inserted as TEXT - the marker is visible in the rendered output as literal characters, no element with a live handler exists, no beacon fires and no console error appears from your payload.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.

## xss.validation.a_csp_with_a_nonce_defeats_the_payload_but_a_nonce_must_be_checked_on_the_landing_page

**Claim.** A reflected XSS on a page whose CSP is nonce-based is only exploitable if the injected markup executes on that same page and inherits its policy; a payload delivered on a page with no CSP header, or a different policy, is not covered by the nonce argument.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

<a id="xss-signal-unique-alnum-marker-reflected-in-response"></a>

## xss.signal.unique_alnum_marker_reflected_in_response

**Claim.** A short unique alphanumeric marker submitted to an entry point and found verbatim in the response is the working precondition signal for reflected XSS.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

<a id="xss-technique-json-response-embedded-into-html-document"></a>

## xss.technique.json_response.embedded_into_html_document

**Claim.** A JSON response served as text/html and interpolated into a page becomes an HTML injection point even though the body is JSON.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.

<a id="xss-test-reject-a-reflected-xss-candidate-when-the-reflec"></a>

## xss.test.reject_a_reflected_xss_candidate_when_the_reflec

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Why it looks vulnerable: your unique probe string comes back in the response body at the exact location you expected, so 'the input is reflected' is satisfied and the report writes itself.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.

<a id="xss-test-reject-a-json-api-endpoint-reported-as-xss-when"></a>

## xss.test.reject_a_json_api_endpoint_reported_as_xss_when

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Why it looks vulnerable: you POST {"name":"<script>alert(1)</script>"} to /api/profile and the string comes back verbatim in the response body - a clean taint-to-reflection path with a classic payload.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.

<a id="xss-test-reject-a-stored-xss-candidate-when-the-submitted"></a>

## xss.test.reject_a_stored_xss_candidate_when_the_submitted

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Why it looks vulnerable: you POST a payload to a comment field or a profile name, it comes back in the response to YOUR own request with a 200, and the marker persists when you reload - so persistence plus reflection looks like stored XSS and a CVSS vector is already chosen.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.

<a id="xss-variant-ht-observe-the-stored-xss-primitive"></a>

## xss.variant.ht_observe_the_stored_xss_primitive

**Claim.** A stored-XSS sink can sit in a message header rather than a web request: the payload is stored alongside the message and later rendered by the mail client, where one click is enough to run it, so mail-rendering paths deserve the same stored-XSS attention as web pages.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

<a id="xss-technique-dom-url-fragment-and-query-as-source"></a>

## xss.technique.dom.url_fragment_and_query_as_source

**Claim.** The URL is the most common DOM XSS source, and the payload can ride in the query string, the fragment, or the path.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, race_condition; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — query: **do** send it in the query string; **observe** URL-decoded value as the app reconstructs it.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — post_write: **do** trigger after a legitimate write; **observe** a stored value re-read on a later request.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.

<a id="xss-technique-dom-sink-list-execution-capable"></a>

## xss.technique.dom.sink_list_execution_capable

**Claim.** document.write, innerHTML, outerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML and jQuery html() are execution-capable sinks, while textContent is not.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.

<a id="xss-technique-dom-innerhtml-rejects-script-use-event-handlers"></a>

## xss.technique.dom.innerhtml_rejects_script_use_event_handlers

**Claim.** An innerHTML sink will not execute an injected script element, so execution requires an event-handler element such as img or iframe.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.

<a id="xss-test-dom-html-sink-marker-via-devtools-control-f"></a>

## xss.test.dom.html_sink_marker_via_devtools_control_f

**Claim.** For DOM XSS you must seed the marker into a client-side source such as location.search and locate it in the live DOM with devtools Control+F, because the browser's View Source never shows JavaScript-injected nodes.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **WHAT transformation sits between you and the sink?** — url: **do** send it percent-encoded once; **observe** whether the decode happens before or after validation.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — cookie: **do** send it in a cookie; **observe** server-side cookie reconstruction.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

## xss.technique.html_attribute.new_event_handler_without_angle_brackets

**Claim.** In an HTML attribute-value context, terminating the value and adding an event-handler attribute executes script even when angle brackets are blocked.

**Claim.** An href attribute value is already a script-capable context, so a javascript: pseudo-protocol executes script without terminating the attribute at all.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-bypass-filter-html-entity-decoding-of-attribute-values"></a>

## xss.bypass.filter.html_entity_decoding_of_attribute_values

**Claim.** HTML-encoding characters the filter blocks defeats it inside an event-handler attribute, because the browser HTML-decodes attribute values before JavaScript runs.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

<a id="xss-validation-encoding-must-match-landing-context"></a>

## xss.validation.encoding_must_match_landing_context

**Claim.** An escape routine that is correct for one context does not protect another, so a finding is wrong until the encoding is shown to match the exact context the value lands in.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — body_json: **do** send it as a JSON value; **observe** whether the parser normalises types.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the body_json? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-test-bypass-entity-backslash-probe-sequence"></a>

## xss.test.bypass.entity_backslash_probe_sequence

**Claim.** When a filter blocks your quote or tag characters, probe the decoder gap in a fixed order - HTML-entity-encode the blocked character first, then prepend a backslash to neutralise the app's own escaping - and a hit proves the filter normalises but does not neutralise.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **WHAT transformation sits between you and the sink?** — url: **do** send it percent-encoded once; **observe** whether the decode happens before or after validation.

**If the first attempt is flat**

You are at the `url` rung. Continue the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.

<a id="xss-test-dom-enumerate-dangerous-sinks-in-bundle"></a>

## xss.test.dom.enumerate_dangerous_sinks_in_bundle

**Claim.** Grepping a downloaded JS bundle for the concrete sink token set - innerHTML, outerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, document.write/writeln, eval, new Function, setTimeout/setInterval with a string first argument, and the jQuery html/append family - is what converts 'this page uses innerHTML somewhere' into a list of lines you can actually test.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — post_write: **do** trigger after a legitimate write; **observe** a stored value re-read on a later request.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

<a id="xss-technique-html-between-tags-new-tags-required"></a>

## xss.technique.html_between_tags.new_tags_required

**Claim.** In the HTML body context the payload must introduce entirely new tags, because the reflection point has no existing quote or delimiter to escape.

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: When a value is reflected into a scriptable attribute such as onclick and the filter blocks the quote character, HTML-encoding it works around the filter.

<a id="xss-test-reject-a-dom-based-xss-candidate-when-the-traced"></a>

## xss.test.reject_a_dom_based_xss_candidate_when_the_traced

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Why it looks vulnerable: the hunter has proven the source is attacker-controlled (location.hash, location.search, document.referrer, postMessage data, an API field) and has seen their marker echoed back in the DOM, so the taint half of the XSS chain is already established and the report feels 90% done.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

## xss.test.a_payload_that_fires_an_alert_only_in_the_hunter

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Step: separate your PoC into two observations. Observation A (execution): a unique alphanumeric marker or alert fires in your own authenticated session, proving the sink.

**Procedure — item-authored procedure** (shapes: fallback; steps from item)

1. Separate your PoC into two observations.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

<a id="xss-technique-dom-clobbering-named-element-shadows-configuration-object"></a>

## xss.technique.dom_clobbering.named_element_shadows_configuration_object

**Claim.** Injected markup with an id or name attribute creates a window/document property that shadows built-in APIs, turning attacker markup into a live configuration object.

**Procedure — State-changing verification** (shapes: state_change, race_condition; steps from template)

1. Capture the pre-state with a read-only request and record it.
2. Perform the single state change.
3. Read the state again THROUGH THE SAME ACCOUNT and, if a second test identity exists, through that identity too.
4. A change visible only to the actor proves write access, not a vulnerability. Cross-account visibility is what makes it one.

**Record:** pre-state, post-state (same identity), post-state (second identity) if available

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

## xss.bypass.trusted_types.dom_sink_requires_policy

**Claim.** A nonce-based CSP only blocks injected inline script, so DOM sinks and dangling markup remain exploitable under the same policy.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.

## xss.technique.a_reflected_or_stored_cross_site_scripting_entry_point_is

**Claim.** A reflected or stored cross-site scripting entry point is confirmed when a chosen script payload executes in the page context rather than being escaped into inert text.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.

## xss.validation.dom.url_encoded_source_kills_payload

**Claim.** If a DOM source value is URL-encoded before reaching the sink the markup payload cannot survive, making the candidate a false positive.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHAT transformation sits between you and the sink?** — url: **do** send it percent-encoded once; **observe** whether the decode happens before or after validation.

**Claim.** A filter blocking parentheses is bypassed by invoking the function without them, for example with a throw statement and a global exception handler.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

## xss.auto.01

**Claim.** XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to complete account compromise.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.

## xss.technique.ht_escaping_script_tag_if_your_co

**Claim.** When reflected data is placed inside a script block, terminating the script element is enough to get an event handler out of it, so escaping single quotes in that context buys nothing and the tester should probe the script context rather than the quoted string.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-technique-hth-example-of-an-insecure-implementat"></a>

## xss.technique.hth_example_of_an_insecure_implementat

**Claim.** The DOM sink to hunt for is a message handler that assigns the received event data straight into innerHTML, which makes the injected markup execute in the receiving page's origin.

<a id="xss-auto-02"></a>

## xss.auto.02

**Claim.** Input validation will not always prevent XSS, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

<a id="xss-signal-dom-executable-source-to-sink-path"></a>

## xss.signal.dom.executable_source_to_sink_path

**Claim.** DOM XSS exists only where an attacker-controllable source reaches an execution-capable sink; reading the source alone is not a finding.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — cookie: **do** send it in a cookie; **observe** server-side cookie reconstruction.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the cookie? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xss-test-dom-prove-source-to-sink-path-with-debugger"></a>

## xss.test.dom.prove_source_to_sink_path_with_debugger

**Claim.** A DOM XSS claim is only proven when the debugger shows an actual value flowing from a source read into an execution sink, because grepping source and sink names separately proves nothing about the path between them.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, race_condition; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — cookie: **do** send it in a cookie; **observe** server-side cookie reconstruction.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — warm: **do** repeat after a success; **observe** behaviour once a cached/derived artefact exists.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

<a id="xss-technique-ht-classify-the-final-execution-conte"></a>

## xss.technique.ht_classify_the_final_execution_conte

**Claim.** The same injection in an extension is triaged by where it lands, not by whether it 'works': script in a Manifest V3 service worker is a message/API and code-injection review because there is no DOM to modify, while a sandboxed page is the documented exception to the usual MV3 CSP rule.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.

<a id="xss-signal-ht-the-problematic-javascript-part-o"></a>

## xss.signal.ht_the_problematic_javascript_part_o

**Claim.** The XSS sink to hunt for in extension code is the pattern of reading a value out of an input, concatenating it into an HTML string and appending the result to the DOM, because that route is open even where the extension CSP blocks eval-like and inline script execution.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.

<a id="xss-auto-03"></a>

## xss.auto.03

**Claim.** Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

<a id="xss-technique-postmessage-receiver-must-validate-event-origin"></a>

## xss.technique.postmessage.receiver_must_validate_event_origin

**Claim.** A page that handles postMessage without validating event.origin accepts attacker-controlled input from any origin.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, race_condition; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — http2: **do** negotiate h2/h2c; **observe** frame-level parsing differences.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
