## xxe.validation.proof_is_a_reference_resolved_to_a_resource_the_submitted_document_did_not_contain

**Claim.** An XXE is proved by the parser resolving an external reference to a resource the submitted document never contained — a request the server issued to an attacker-controlled listener, or file content appearing that only exists on the host — because that is the observable effect entity resolution causes.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="xxe-technique-xml-external-entity-injection-is-provable-by-defining-an-e"></a>

## xxe.technique.xml_external_entity_injection_is_provable_by_defining_an_e

**Claim.** XML external entity injection is provable by defining an entity that expands to a known local file and observing that content in the response.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

<a id="xxe-signal-doctype-and-entity-accepted-by-parser"></a>

## xxe.signal.doctype_and_entity_accepted_by_parser

**Claim.** A parser that accepts a DOCTYPE declaration and resolves its entity is the enabling condition for XXE; the submitted payload alone proves nothing.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

<a id="xxe-technique-external-dtd-reference-is-the-core-probe"></a>

## xxe.technique.external_dtd_reference_is_the_core_probe

**Claim.** Submitting a DOCTYPE with an external SYSTEM or PUBLIC identifier is the probe that reveals whether the parser resolves entities at all.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Blind / out-of-band confirmation* — Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.

<a id="xxe-bypass-entities-parsed-by-a-framework-level-xml-pipeline-escape-the-endpoint-level-configuration"></a>

## xxe.bypass.entities_parsed_by_a_framework_level_xml_pipeline_escape_the_endpoint_level_configuration

**Claim.** Configuring the entity policy on the application's own XML parser call does not cover the parsers a framework or container instantiate internally for XSLT, tag library descriptors, JSP documents or configuration files, so those secondary parsers can bypass the entity limits the application believes it set.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — http2: **do** negotiate h2/h2c; **observe** frame-level parsing differences.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.

<a id="xxe-test-configuring-the-entity-policy-on-the-application"></a>

## xxe.test.configuring_the_entity_policy_on_the_application

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: How to apply it in the field: treat this as the bypass it is — a hunter must be able to state the concrete observation that demonstrates it, with a request and response in hand, before the finding is reportable.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.

<a id="xxe-validation-inbound-dtd-callback-confirms-resolution"></a>

## xxe.validation.inbound_dtd_callback_confirms_resolution

**Claim.** An XXE finding is validated only when an inbound HTTP request to the supplied entity URL was actually observed on a listener you control.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

<a id="xxe-test-reject-a-xxe-finding-until-it-is-distinguished-f"></a>

## xxe.test.reject_a_xxe_finding_until_it_is_distinguished_f

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Hypothesis under test: A parser that accepts a DOCTYPE declaration and resolves its entity is the enabling condition for XXE; the submitted payload alone proves nothing.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.

<a id="xxe-test-a-parser-configured-with-network-access-disabled"></a>

## xxe.test.a_parser_configured_with_network_access_disabled

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: How to apply it in the field: treat this as the fp_rule it is — a hunter must be able to state the concrete observation that demonstrates it, with a request and response in hand, before the finding is reportable.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.

<a id="xxe-technique-ht-external-entities-defined-with-a"></a>

## xxe.technique.ht_external_entities_defined_with_a

**Claim.** The risk lives in how the parser resolves external data sources, so the probe is a document that carries a DOCTYPE and an entity declaration; parameter entities are the escalation path once a plain external entity is refused.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.

<a id="xxe-test-a-parsed-document-that-returned-200-with-a-defin"></a>

## xxe.test.a_parsed_document_that_returned_200_with_a_defin

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Mechanism: A parsed document that returned 200 with a defined entity reflected in the output is not an XXE finding; the entity may have been expanded from the document's own internal DTD, which is normal XML processing, and the flaw requires the parser to resolve a reference to an external resource or a local file.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

<a id="xxe-signal-ht-this-indicates-a-successful-xxe-x"></a>

## xxe.signal.ht_this_indicates_a_successful_xxe_x

**Claim.** An attacker-controlled out-of-band callback plus entity-derived data arriving on the error channel in the same probe is the positive confirmation that external entity resolution succeeded, not merely that the parser tolerated a DOCTYPE.

**Procedure — Blind / out-of-band confirmation** (shapes: blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.
2. Then test the vulnerable condition. Absence of a callback is only meaningful once the channel is proven.
3. Record the callback evidence (resolved host, token, timestamp) — a blind result with no artefact is not reportable.

**Record:** channel self-test, callback artefact, timing

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

<a id="xxe-auto-t-51e293ac"></a>

## xxe.auto.t.51e293ac

**Claim.** Data retrieval The most common XXE injection vulnerability lets attackers prompt a server to disclose sensitive data or files in an HTTP response.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.

## xxe.auto.t.c13a8eaa

**Claim.** Error-based information disclosure Our server is vulnerable to blind XXE injection methods if an attacker can retrieve valuable data by examining the error messages our server emits.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, encoding_ladder, filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

## xxe.variant.ht_svg_being_an_xml_based_format_ca

**Claim.** Any upload surface that accepts SVG inherits the parser exposure, because the format is XML and a crafted image is a delivery channel for external entity resolution inside the backend.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.

**Claim.** 5 ]> In this code, the targeted server will try to send the HTTP request to the attacker’s server URL.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, encoding_ladder, filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.

**Claim.** In a payload with ten or more levels of nested entities, the resulting file can be hundreds of gigabytes, typically causing an out-of-memory error for the server attempting to parse the SVG file — and a denial of service for our users.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

**Claim.** In a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack, an attacker will typically inject a URL or address pointing to the vulnerable server’s local file system instance or other restricted-access resources — especially when user inputs are not properly filtered by the XML parser.

**Claim.** 9 userInfo > The ifconfig command in this example returns the server’s network configuration when the XML parser evaluates the xxe entity.

**Procedure — Encoding / normalisation ladder** (shapes: encoding_ladder, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.
2. Send each rung with the baseline procedure (one variable changed).
3. Record which rung first produces an effect. That rung identifies the decoding layer the application applies, and where the check and the decode disagree.
4. Verify WHERE normalisation happened: reflect the value in a way only the server could compute. Client-side canonicalisation proves nothing about the server.

**Record:** rung that first differed, decoding layer inferred, server-side reflection evidence

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
