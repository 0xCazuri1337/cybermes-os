## graphql.test.introspection_finding_requires_a_populated_schema_response_from_an_unauthenticated_caller

**Claim.** Introspection is only a finding when an unauthenticated request to the production endpoint returns a populated __schema or __type payload naming the server's own types and fields, and an empty or errored response from the same request fails the test.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — cached: **do** add a cache-buster, then repeat without; **observe** whether a cached 200 masked the real path.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — cookie: **do** send it in a cookie; **observe** server-side cookie reconstruction.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — anonymous: **do** send with no credentials; **observe** whether the route is reachable pre-auth.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the cookie? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="graphql-test-cost-amplification-requires-n-distinct-side-effects-or-an-error-count-from-one-request"></a>

## graphql.test.cost_amplification_requires_n_distinct_side_effects_or_an_error_count_from_one_request

**Claim.** Alias or batch amplification is proved only when one HTTP request produces N distinct observable side effects - N created rows, N outbound backend calls visible in the response, or N distinct resolver results each carrying a different server-generated value - rather than merely N aliases appearing in the query text.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Filesystem sink confirmation* — Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.

<a id="graphql-bypass-frontend-only-field-authz"></a>

## graphql.bypass.frontend_only_field_authz

**Claim.** Authorization applied only in the frontend selection set is bypassed by requesting the hidden field directly, because the resolver returns it regardless of who asked.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.

<a id="graphql-test-depth-dos-requires-a-measured-server-side-cost-at-a-depth-the-endpoint-does-not-reject"></a>

## graphql.test.depth_dos_requires_a_measured_server_side_cost_at_a_depth_the_endpoint_does_not_reject

**Claim.** A depth or complexity denial-of-service is proved when the same operation at increasing nesting depth is accepted and the server-side cost rises measurably with depth - response time, resolver count, or database queries per second on the backend - rather than by the existence of a deep query in a request body.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — warm: **do** repeat after a success; **observe** behaviour once a cached/derived artefact exists.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="graphql-technique-graphql-introspection-and-shadow-api"></a>

## graphql.technique.graphql_introspection_and_shadow_api

**Claim.** A GraphQL API with introspection enabled in production discloses the types and operations the endpoint supports, including operations reserved for high-privilege users, and an undocumented endpoint absent from the gateway route table discloses by existing at all.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — proxied: **do** request through the proxy/CDN; **observe** normalisation the proxy adds or strips.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — anonymous: **do** send with no credentials; **observe** whether the route is reachable pre-auth.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat through the proxy? Compare against the ORIGIN directly if reachable — the difference is the proxy's contribution.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="graphql-signal-universal-query-and-schema-fields"></a>

## graphql.signal.universal_query_and_schema_fields

**Claim.** A response carrying {"data":{"__typename":"query"}}, or a populated __schema/__type block, confirms a live GraphQL root type rather than a lookalike REST route.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="graphql-tech-nested-and-amount-dos"></a>

## graphql.tech.nested_and_amount_dos

**Claim.** A deeply nested query or a huge pagination argument runs unbounded resolver work when no depth or amount limit is configured, exhausting DB connections and CPU.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="graphql-validation-rate-limit-bypass-proof"></a>

## graphql.validation.rate_limit_bypass_proof

**Claim.** Proving rate-limit bypass requires observing N real side effects from one HTTP request after the same operation standalone was throttled at k attempts.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="graphql-tech-alias-and-batch-amplification"></a>

## graphql.tech.alias_and_batch_amplification

**Claim.** Aliasing one field N times, or posting a JSON array of N operations, multiplies resolver executions past per-request rate limits because limiters count HTTP requests, not operations.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="graphql-bypass-a-filter-rule-scoped-to-a-list-of-operations-leaves-the-others-unfiltered"></a>

## graphql.bypass.a_filter_rule_scoped_to_a_list_of_operations_leaves_the_others_unfiltered

**Claim.** An authorization rule declared with an explicit operations list applies only to those operations, so a filter written for READ leaves UPDATE, DELETE and AGGREGATE unguarded on the same type.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Filesystem sink confirmation* — Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
