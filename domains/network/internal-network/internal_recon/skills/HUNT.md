# HUNT runbook — internal_recon

**3 promoted technique/test/variant items**, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from the shape of the claim. Generated from `db/wks.db`; do not hand-edit (regenerate with `python tools/playbook.py internal_recon network`).

Sources of steps: 0 item-authored, 3 template-derived (a template step is the SHAPE's procedure, not a claim-specific one — treat those as the starting point and adapt).

## internal_recon.auto.03

**Claim.** We are not claiming complete detection of every custom deserializer.\n\n## How this Java deserialization vulnerability differs from Log4Shell\nLog4j 2 can *emit* log events over the network (for example, `SocketAppender`).

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Filesystem sink confirmation* — Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.

## internal_recon.bypass.rpcclient_through_socks_proxy_hides_command_line

**Claim.** Routing rpcclient enumeration through a Cobalt Strike socks proxy causes the enumeration arguments to never appear in the host's process-creation command line, so command-line based detection of internal domain recon returns nothing.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — proxied: **do** request through the proxy/CDN; **observe** normalisation the proxy adds or strips.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat through the proxy? Compare against the ORIGIN directly if reachable — the difference is the proxy's contribution.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

## internal_recon.auto.01

**Claim.** If you need to know which tenant an event came from, this is how. */\n| WHERE user.name == \"svc-deploy\" AND event.category == \"authentication\"\n| KEEP _index, @timestamp, event.action, source.ip, host.name\n /* KEEP is not cosmetic.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
