# Service-Specific Configuration Assessment

> surface: `net` · CWE: CWE-16 · OWASP: —
> maturity: **mature** — 16 items, 16 supported, 2 FP rules, 1 chains

A service's own configuration — signing, binding, authentication method — determines whether its protocol weaknesses are reachable.

**Aliases:** service configuration, configuration assessment, service hardening, protocol configuration, misconfigured service

## Technique

- **Whether a service's protocol weaknesses are reachable is decided by that service's own configuration — signing requirements, binding, authentication method and lockout policy — so service identification must be followed by configuration assessment before any weakness is asserted.**  
  `high_confidence` · score 0.8775 · disproved by: If the service enforces signing and strong authentication with lockout applied, then the protocol weaknesses that enumeration would suggest are not reachable and the class yields no finding for that service.

## Fp Rule

- **A TCP banner that reveals the service name and version is information disclosure and is not an authorization bypass, an authentication weakness, or a remote-code-execution finding; file it under information disclosure only, and only when the version actually maps to a known-vulnerable build.**  
  `high_confidence` · score 0.874 · disproved by: The disclosed version maps to a published CVE with a working exploit path, or the banner itself carries a credential or internal hostname that was not already known to the assessment scope - in which case the disclosure is materially different from a routine version string.

- **Reject a service_enumeration_detail finding until it is distinguished from the adjacent behaviour this class also covers. "Whether a service's protocol weaknesses are reachable is decided by that service's own configuration — signing requirements, binding, authentication method and lockout policy — so service identification must be followed by configuration..." and "As a result, it is imperative that organizations implement exposure management, which is the proactive cybersecurity approach of identifying, assessing, and addressing potential vulnerabilities and risks before they can be exploited." share a surface and a symptom, so a response that matches the first is not evidence for it while the second remains possible.**  
  `high_confidence` · score 0.869 · disproved by: This rule is wrong if a controlled test shows the two behaviours can never co-occur on the same surface, or if the corpus entry for "As a result, it is imperative that organizations implement exposure ma" is out of date. In that case this class needs its false-positive guidance rewritten rather than deleted.
