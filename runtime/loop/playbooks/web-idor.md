# Hunt card — idor

14 promoted technique/test items, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from its shape.

## idor.technique.an_insecure_direct_object_reference_is_proven_by_requestin

**Claim.** An insecure direct object reference is proven by requesting an identical endpoint under another user's identifier and receiving that user's record instead of a 403/404.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## idor.technique.swap_identifier_all_carriers

**Claim.** The core test is substituting the object identifier in every carrier of the same request - path, query, body, and header - with no other change.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## idor.signal.response_differs_for_other_user_ids

**Claim.** A response that differs materially when you substitute another user's object id (200 + their data instead of 403/404) is the primary recon signal for BOLA.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## idor.validation.two_account_cross_tenant_read

**Claim.** Cross-tenant read is only proven when user A retrieves an object created and exclusively owned by user B, with the two accounts fully separated.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## idor.signal.gap_sequences_and_leaked_foreign_ids

**Claim.** Gaps in otherwise sequential id sequences, and object responses that embed foreign owner ids, are recon signals that a collection is enumerable and unfiltered.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## idor.technique.hth_insecure_direct_object_references

**Claim.** The IDOR test is to modify the value of the parameter that points directly at an object and observe whether authorization is still enforced for the newly referenced object.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## idor.technique.hth_such_resources_can_be_database_ent

**Claim.** Object ids that are GUIDs or so-called encrypted values must still be tested, because obscuring the object id is not an ownership check.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

## idor.test.cross_tenant_read_is_only_proven_when_user_a_ret

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: As B, create a distinctive object (a draft document titled IDOR_CANARY_B_<random>, a support ticket, an invoice for a unique amount).

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## idor.bypass.a_table_owner_or_bypassrls_role_erases_the_row_level_policy

**Claim.** When object scoping is delegated to PostgreSQL row-level security, the policy is not the control if the connecting role is a superuser, has BYPASSRLS, or is the table owner - each of those silently ignores every policy on the table.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## idor.bypass.check_after_use_unchecked_method_mass_assignment

**Claim.** The most common bypass is a check that runs after the object is already used, or a path where method/owner fields are never validated at all.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

## idor.technique.ht_auth_matrix_forced_browse_git

**Claim.** IDOR coverage comes from pairing a forced-browse / auth-matrix pass that maps which roles may reach each endpoint with bulk sweeps of collected object ids, rather than probing one identifier at a time by hand.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## idor.validation.two_account_cross_tenant_write

**Claim.** Cross-tenant write is proven only when user A's mutation changes state on B's object and B observes the change in their own authenticated session.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

## idor.test.ht_authenticated_low_privilege_session

**Claim.** The minimal IDOR proof keeps one authenticated low-privilege session fixed and changes only the object ID, so any difference in the response is attributable to the missing authorization check rather than to session state.

**Procedure — State-changing verification** (shapes: state_change)

1. Capture the pre-state with a read-only request and record it.
2. Perform the single state change.
3. Read the state again THROUGH THE SAME ACCOUNT and, if a second test identity exists, through that identity too.
4. A change visible only to the actor proves write access, not a vulnerability. Cross-account visibility is what makes it one.

**Record:** pre-state, post-state (same identity), post-state (second identity) if available

## idor.test.ht_validate_idor_bola_only_with_two_a

**Claim.** An IDOR/BOLA finding is only validated with two identities the tester controls, because a hardware serial number seen on the device proves nothing about the server-side ownership check on the object id.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result
