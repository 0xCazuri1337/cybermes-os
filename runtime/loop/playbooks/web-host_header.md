# Hunt card — host_header

9 promoted technique/test items, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from its shape.

## host_header.technique.x_forwarded_host_overrides_a_validated_host_header

**Claim.** When a front-end injects X-Forwarded-Host to preserve the original host through a load balancer, an attacker can inject the payload through that header and bypass validation applied to Host, because the framework resolves the override header instead of the validated one.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filter_bypass)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## host_header.validation.prove_host_injection_with_a_password_reset_url_rewrite

**Claim.** The convincing host-header validation is a request/response pair where a reset or confirmation email is requested while sending a foreign Host, and the response body contains an absolute link or token-bearing URL pointing at the attacker's domain rather than the legitimate one.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## host_header.test.calling_a_reflected_host_value_web_cache_poisoni

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: How to apply it in the field: treat this as the fp_rule it is — a hunter must be able to state the concrete observation that demonstrates it, with a request and response in hand, before the finding is reportable.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## host_header.test.a_server_returning_200_for_an_arbitrary_host_hea

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Mechanism: A server returning 200 for an arbitrary Host header is not by itself a vulnerability; the finding survives only when the unrecognised host changes the response content, produces a redirect, an absolute URL to an attacker domain, or a password-reset link built from the host.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## host_header.test.an_attacker_controlled_hostname_appearing_inside

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Mechanism: An attacker-controlled hostname appearing inside an absolute URL in a response body is not an open redirect, because the user must still act on a link whose destination is chosen by the application; the class is open redirect only when the server itself issues a 3xx whose Location the attacker controls.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## host_header.test.the_convincing_host_header_validation_is_a_reque

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Mechanism: The convincing host-header validation is a request/response pair where a reset or confirmation email is requested while sending a foreign Host, and the response body contains an absolute link or token-bearing URL pointing at the attacker's domain rather than the legitimate one.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## host_header.technique.hth_if_you_come_across_api_json_in_an

**Claim.** On any AEM instance the /api.json path is worth poisoning with Host, X-Forwarded-Server and X-Forwarded-Host (or a localhost Host value) to see whether an attacker-controlled host value ends up in a cached response.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

## host_header.bypass.x_forwarded_host_trusted_without_a_known_proxy_allowlist

**Claim.** When an application trusts X-Forwarded-Host or equivalent proxy headers to build absolute URLs, the control that must exist is a list of hops whose forwarding headers are honoured, and the bypass is sending that header directly from outside that list and getting it reflected.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filter_bypass, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## host_header.test.when_an_application_trusts_x_forwarded_host_or_e

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: How to apply it in the field: treat this as the bypass it is — a hunter must be able to state the concrete observation that demonstrates it, with a request and response in hand, before the finding is reportable.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
