# Hunt card — ssrf

23 promoted technique/test items, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from its shape.

## ssrf.validation.identify_which_component_parsed

**Claim.** A bypass is only proven when the component that actually performs the fetch resolved a different host than the validating component approved.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filter_bypass)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.technique.hth_the_attacker_can_supply_or_modify

**Claim.** The attacker action in an SSRF is supplying or modifying the URL that server-side code dereferences, which makes any parameter that changes the fetch destination the entry point to hunt for.

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.technique.internal_loopback_trust_escalation

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.technique.url_parser_differential

**Claim.** Allowlist validators and the back-end HTTP client parse URLs differently, so a URL the validator accepts can still resolve elsewhere.

## ssrf.test.a_payload_that_a_blocklist_rejects_and_which_pro

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: A 4xx, a validation error, or a silent drop with no collaborator traffic is the expected outcome of working filtering.

## ssrf.technique.ht_however_in_case_there_is_no_syste

**Claim.** When a VM has several user-assigned managed identities and no system-assigned one, the metadata service errors out instead of issuing a token, so identity enumeration has to pivot to the platform configuration endpoint to learn which identities exist.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.

## ssrf.test.a_confirmed_blind_ssrf_callback_proves_request_i

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Without a readable response you cannot show what was retrieved, so keep the finding scoped to 'server makes attacker-directed requests' and state the unproven parts explicitly.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.variant.ht_5_2_ssrf_to_rce_historical_6_3

**Claim.** Where a request parameter takes an arbitrary URL, feeding it a loopback admin address and observing the server act on the fetched content is the test that turns that parameter into an SSRF sink and the entry point for escalation to code execution.

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.technique.ht_this_setup_exposes_a_vulnerability

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.technique.ht_if_the_library_builds_the_request

**Claim.** Newlines smuggled through a filename field can inject extra headers into the outbound request, which is how a cloud metadata service that demands specific headers is reached from a server-side request.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.technique.ht_1_confirm_blind_ssrf_with_oast_2

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.signal.ht_dns_failures_tls_validation_error

**Claim.** Errors that depart from the baseline of a well-formed URL - DNS failure, TLS validation error, 401 from a metadata service, scheme-parsing error - are usable as positive proof that a server-side outbound request was issued and reached internal-only destinations.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, blind_confirmation)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.signal.hth_blind_ssrf_blind_ssrf_s_are_those

**Claim.** An SSRF whose response never returns the fetched content is blind, so the response body alone cannot confirm the server-side fetch and the finding has to rest on out-of-band evidence instead.

**Procedure — Blind / out-of-band confirmation** (shapes: blind_confirmation)

1. Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.
2. Then test the vulnerable condition. Absence of a callback is only meaningful once the channel is proven.
3. Record the callback evidence (resolved host, token, timestamp) — a blind result with no artefact is not reportable.

**Record:** channel self-test, callback artefact, timing

## ssrf.validation.dns_only_equals_egress_filter

**Claim.** A DNS lookup with no follow-up HTTP request indicates the request was blocked by network filtering, not that the SSRF is a false positive.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.bypass.dns_rebinding_defeats_a_check_made_once_before_the_request

**Claim.** An SSRF filter that resolves the hostname and checks the IP once, before connecting, is defeated by DNS rebinding, because the address the client connects to is resolved again and may differ.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filter_bypass, blind_confirmation)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.technique.ht_tooling_aem_hacker_swiss_army

**Claim.** Enumerate the whole parameter surface with an automated sweep rather than by hand, because a single enumeration script bundles SSRF detection together with dispatcher-bypass attempts, making untrusted-origin reachability the first property to establish on the target.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.variant.ht_even_if_one_remote_driver_only_sup

**Claim.** Clearing one read-only callback handler does not clear the SSRF surface, because other registered backends in the same registry may still accept writes, so every registered handler has to be exercised before the feature is called safe.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.signal.hth_firefox_referrer_https_your_co

**Claim.** A referrer-analysing service on the target side records the Referer URL the browser sends, so a collaborator-domain URL appearing in a referrer log confirms that outbound traffic to a URL the attacker chose was generated.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, blind_confirmation)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## ssrf.validation.a_blocklist_of_resolved_addresses_is_not_the_same_as_an_address_space_check

**Claim.** A filter that rejects a named set of internal addresses is weaker than an address-space check, because every address belongs to one of three spaces and the classification is defined by what the address means rather than by its literal value.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, state_change)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink
