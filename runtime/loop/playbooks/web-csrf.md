# Hunt card — csrf

14 promoted technique/test items, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from its shape.

## csrf.validation.cross_site_state_change_without_token

**Claim.** A cross-site POST that changes server state while carrying the victim's ambient cookie and no anti-CSRF token proves CSRF rather than a same-origin caller.

**Procedure — item-authored procedure** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Replay the victim's state-changing request as a bare form POST from an attacker origin, with no custom request header and no token parameter, and record the response status against a baseline captured with the same cookie sent as a same-origin client request.

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.bypass.token_validation_skipped_for_get_method

**Claim.** A CSRF defence that validates the anti-CSRF token only on POST is bypassed by reissuing the identical state change as a GET, because many endpoints accept either method.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.bypass.samesite_lax_defeated_by_method_override_verb

**Claim.** SameSite=Lax still attaches the session cookie to a top-level GET navigation, so a server that accepts a form submission over GET, or honours a framework method-override parameter, reopens CSRF despite SameSite being set.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.bypass.token_validated_only_when_present

**Claim.** A CSRF check written as validate-if-present is bypassed by deleting the whole token parameter, because an absent parameter is never compared against the expected value.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.technique.hth_csrf_will_be_login_logout_resetp

**Claim.** A hunter can break anti-forgery defences without ever forging a token value, by changing the request shape itself: switching the request method POST to GET, dropping the token parameter, blanking it, replaying an unused valid token, feeding the victim the attacker's own token, matching only the token's length, mutating one character, or switching Content-Type to a multipart form instead of json/x-www-form-urlencoded.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.technique.cross_site_websocket_handshake_is_csrf

**Claim.** A WebSocket handshake that relies on the session cookie is a CSRF target, so cross-site WebSocket hijacking is the same request-forgery class aimed at a different handshake.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filter_bypass, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.validation.a_get_that_mutates_state_is_the_condition_not_the_token_check

**Claim.** CSRF is only reportable on an endpoint whose effect survives being reached without the victim's intent, so the decisive evidence is a state change caused by a cross-site request, not a 200 on a hand-rolled POST.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.variant.hth_if_the_page_where_the_vulnerable_e

**Claim.** Where an endpoint's page is itself clickjacking-vulnerable, the same state change can be driven by framing the page, which makes the anti-forgery token irrelevant rather than broken.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.technique.samesite_unprotected_state_change_replay

**Claim.** A state-changing request replayed from an attacker origin without an anti-CSRF token succeeds when the session cookie carries no effective SameSite restriction.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.technique.fetch_metadata_sec_fetch_site_blocks_cross_site_writes

**Claim.** Rejecting unsafe methods when Sec-Fetch-Site is cross-site, with a mandatory fallback to Origin verification on browsers that omit the headers, blocks CSRF without any token and no client change.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.technique.hth_edit_according_to_your_preference

**Claim.** A cross-site request forgery proof-of-concept can be a standalone auto-submitting HTML form placed on an attacker page, so the evidence reproduces with no session scripting and shows the forged request originates cross-origin.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.bypass.token_not_bound_to_victim_session

**Claim.** A CSRF token accepted from a global pool of issued tokens, rather than bound to the requesting session, is defeated by the attacker logging in with their own account and feeding the victim a token the attacker legitimately holds.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.bypass.samesite_restriction_defeated_by_same_site_xss

**Claim.** SameSite cookie protection is a site-scoped, not origin-scoped, control, so JavaScript execution on any sibling domain of the same site defeats it completely.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## csrf.bypass.a_per_view_exemption_marker_defeats_the_global_token_check

**Claim.** Frameworks that enforce CSRF by default do so through a global middleware plus explicit per-view exemptions, so the bypass is not breaking the token scheme - it is finding a view the middleware was told to skip.

**Procedure — State-changing verification** (shapes: state_change)

1. Capture the pre-state with a read-only request and record it.
2. Perform the single state change.
3. Read the state again THROUGH THE SAME ACCOUNT and, if a second test identity exists, through that identity too.
4. A change visible only to the actor proves write access, not a vulnerability. Cross-account visibility is what makes it one.

**Record:** pre-state, post-state (same identity), post-state (second identity) if available
