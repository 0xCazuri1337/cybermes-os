10 promoted technique/test items, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from its shape.

## graphql.test.introspection_finding_requires_a_populated_schema_response_from_an_unauthenticated_caller

**Claim.** Introspection is only a finding when an unauthenticated request to the production endpoint returns a populated __schema or __type payload naming the server's own types and fields, and an empty or errored response from the same request fails the test.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## graphql.test.cost_amplification_requires_n_distinct_side_effects_or_an_error_count_from_one_request

**Claim.** Alias or batch amplification is proved only when one HTTP request produces N distinct observable side effects - N created rows, N outbound backend calls visible in the response, or N distinct resolver results each carrying a different server-generated value - rather than merely N aliases appearing in the query text.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## graphql.bypass.frontend_only_field_authz

**Claim.** Authorization applied only in the frontend selection set is bypassed by requesting the hidden field directly, because the resolver returns it regardless of who asked.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## graphql.test.depth_dos_requires_a_measured_server_side_cost_at_a_depth_the_endpoint_does_not_reject

**Claim.** A depth or complexity denial-of-service is proved when the same operation at increasing nesting depth is accepted and the server-side cost rises measurably with depth - response time, resolver count, or database queries per second on the backend - rather than by the existence of a deep query in a request body.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## graphql.technique.graphql_introspection_and_shadow_api

**Claim.** A GraphQL API with introspection enabled in production discloses the types and operations the endpoint supports, including operations reserved for high-privilege users, and an undocumented endpoint absent from the gateway route table discloses by existing at all.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## graphql.signal.universal_query_and_schema_fields

**Claim.** A response carrying {"data":{"__typename":"query"}}, or a populated __schema/__type block, confirms a live GraphQL root type rather than a lookalike REST route.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## graphql.tech.nested_and_amount_dos

**Claim.** A deeply nested query or a huge pagination argument runs unbounded resolver work when no depth or amount limit is configured, exhausting DB connections and CPU.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## graphql.validation.rate_limit_bypass_proof

**Claim.** Proving rate-limit bypass requires observing N real side effects from one HTTP request after the same operation standalone was throttled at k attempts.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## graphql.tech.alias_and_batch_amplification

**Claim.** Aliasing one field N times, or posting a JSON array of N operations, multiplies resolver executions past per-request rate limits because limiters count HTTP requests, not operations.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

## graphql.bypass.a_filter_rule_scoped_to_a_list_of_operations_leaves_the_others_unfiltered

**Claim.** An authorization rule declared with an explicit operations list applies only to those operations, so a filter written for READ leaves UPDATE, DELETE and AGGREGATE unguarded on the same type.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filter_bypass, filesystem_sink, state_change)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions
