# HUNT runbook — ad_kerberos

**6 promoted technique/test/variant items**, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from the shape of the claim. Generated from `db/wks.db`; do not hand-edit (regenerate with `python tools/playbook.py ad_kerberos network`).

Sources of steps: 0 item-authored, 6 template-derived (a template step is the SHAPE's procedure, not a claim-specific one — treat those as the starting point and adapt).

## ad_kerberos.technique.kerberoast_rc4_tgs_offline_crack

**Claim.** A Kerberos service ticket whose SPN is issued to an account with no interactive login (a service principal) is an offline password-cracking oracle when the KDC still protects it with RC4, because the ticket's encrypted part is keyed on the account password hash.

**Procedure — Race / TOCTOU attempt** (shapes: race_condition; steps from template)

1. Identify the check and the use as TWO separate operations, and measure the gap between them.
2. Fire many parallel attempts (tens to hundreds) so at least one lands inside the window.
3. Vary ONLY the timing; the payload and session stay fixed.
4. Report a rate, not a single success: N successes in M attempts both proves the window and tells the reader whether it is practical to exploit.

**Record:** attempts, successes, success rate, window size if measurable

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

## ad_kerberos.signal.tgs-fanout-to-many-unique-spns

**Claim.** A single host receiving TGS-REP responses for numerous unique SPNs inside a short window is an early observable for Kerberoasting but is identical to legitimate service-ticket traffic.

**Procedure — Race / TOCTOU attempt** (shapes: race_condition; steps from template)

1. Identify the check and the use as TWO separate operations, and measure the gap between them.
2. Fire many parallel attempts (tens to hundreds) so at least one lands inside the window.
3. Vary ONLY the timing; the payload and session stay fixed.
4. Report a rate, not a single success: N successes in M attempts both proves the window and tells the reader whether it is practical to exploit.

**Record:** attempts, successes, success rate, window size if measurable

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

<a id="ad-kerberos-technique-spn-set-is-the-roastable-precondition"></a>

## ad_kerberos.technique.spn_set_is_the_roastable_precondition

**Claim.** An AD account with a service principal name set is requestable by any authenticated domain principal, and the returned ticket is encrypted with the account's own long-term key, so the SPN inventory is the precondition that makes offline key recovery a single request away.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="ad-kerberos-technique-asrep-roast-preauth-disabled"></a>

## ad_kerberos.technique.asrep_roast_preauth_disabled

**Claim.** A domain account configured with 'do not require Kerberos preauthentication' will return an AS-REP containing ticket-granting data to an unauthenticated AS-REQ, turning the authentication service into an offline password-cracking oracle for that account.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What must be TRUE server-side for this to bite?** — warm: **do** repeat after a success; **observe** behaviour once a cached/derived artefact exists.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — anonymous: **do** send with no credentials; **observe** whether the route is reachable pre-auth.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="ad-kerberos-technique-krbtgt-hash-ticket-forgery"></a>

## ad_kerberos.technique.krbtgt_hash_ticket_forgery

**Claim.** Possession of the KRBTGT account password hash is sufficient to forge arbitrary Kerberos ticket-granting tickets for any principal in the forest, because KRBTGT is the key that signs and encrypts every TGT in that domain.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

<a id="ad-kerberos-technique-kerberoasting-targets-service-tickets-for-accounts-with-a"></a>

## ad_kerberos.technique.kerberoasting_targets_service_tickets_for_accounts_with_a

**Claim.** Kerberoasting targets service tickets for accounts with a pre-authentication setting that permits it, and the returned ticket is cracked offline for the account password.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — anonymous: **do** send with no credentials; **observe** whether the route is reachable pre-auth.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
