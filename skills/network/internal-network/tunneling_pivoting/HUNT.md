# HUNT runbook — tunneling_pivoting

**9 promoted technique/test/variant items**, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from the shape of the claim. Generated from `db/wks.db`; do not hand-edit (regenerate with `python tools/playbook.py tunneling_pivoting network`).

Sources of steps: 0 item-authored, 9 template-derived (a template step is the SHAPE's procedure, not a claim-specific one — treat those as the starting point and adapt).

## tunneling_pivoting.test.an_ssh_or_socks_tunnel_inside_the_estate_is_not

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Discard when the tunnel was observed entirely between hosts inside the scoped network: the intrusion report shows the actor's SSH tunnel was built to present RDP access from a public IP address they owned, which is what distinguishes ingress from internal administration.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="tunneling-pivoting-technique-encapsulation-reintroduces-forbidden-reachability"></a>

## tunneling_pivoting.technique.encapsulation_reintroduces_forbidden_reachability

**Claim.** A tunnel carries one protocol inside another, so a reachability that policy forbids directly can be reintroduced through a host both sides accept — the boundary that matters is the tunnel endpoint, not the inner protocol.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — proxied: **do** request through the proxy/CDN; **observe** normalisation the proxy adds or strips.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat through the proxy? Compare against the ORIGIN directly if reachable — the difference is the proxy's contribution.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="tunneling-pivoting-technique-a-pivot-is-established-by-tunnelling-traffic-for-a-second"></a>

## tunneling_pivoting.technique.a_pivot_is_established_by_tunnelling_traffic_for_a_second

**Claim.** A pivot is established by tunnelling traffic for a second network segment through the already-compromised host, which carries no credentials of its own.

**Procedure — Race / TOCTOU attempt** (shapes: race_condition; steps from template)

1. Identify the check and the use as TWO separate operations, and measure the gap between them.
2. Fire many parallel attempts (tens to hundreds) so at least one lands inside the window.
3. Vary ONLY the timing; the payload and session stay fixed.
4. Report a rate, not a single success: N successes in M attempts both proves the window and tells the reader whether it is practical to exploit.

**Record:** attempts, successes, success rate, window size if measurable

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

## tunneling_pivoting.auto.t.bc833899

**Claim.** Using one compromised machine to access another is called pivoting and allows us to access networks and resources that are not directly accessible to us through the compromised host.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.

## tunneling_pivoting.auto.t.51fb5531

**Claim.** Tunneling is a technique that allows us to encapsulate traffic within another protocol so that it looks like a benign traffic stream.

## tunneling_pivoting.auto.t.1139f69f

**Claim.** The CrackMapExec tool, known as a "Swiss Army Knife" for testing networks, facilitates enumeration, attacks, and post-exploitation that can be leveraged against most any domain using multiple network protocols.

## tunneling_pivoting.auto.01

**Claim.** This is known as pivoting and enables lateral movement through the network.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — proxied: **do** request through the proxy/CDN; **observe** normalisation the proxy adds or strips.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat through the proxy? Compare against the ORIGIN directly if reachable — the difference is the proxy's contribution.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

## tunneling_pivoting.auto.t.5dd47cac

**Claim.** These flaws enable attackers to upload malicious files, execute arbitrary commands on the back-end server, and even take control over the entire server and all web applications hosted on it and potentially gain access to sensitive data or cause a service disruption.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.
