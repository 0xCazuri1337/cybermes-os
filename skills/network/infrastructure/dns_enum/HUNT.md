# HUNT runbook — dns_enum

**7 promoted technique/test/variant items**, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from the shape of the claim. Generated from `db/wks.db`; do not hand-edit (regenerate with `python tools/playbook.py dns_enum network`).

Sources of steps: 0 item-authored, 7 template-derived (a template step is the SHAPE's procedure, not a claim-specific one — treat those as the starting point and adapt).

<a id="dns-enum-technique-nsec-next-owner-name-walks-the-whole-zone"></a>

## dns_enum.technique.nsec_next_owner_name_walks_the_whole_zone

**Claim.** A negative answer from a DNSSEC-signed zone that uses NSEC rather than NSEC3 carries the next existing owner name in its authority section, so an anonymous client can follow that chain and walk the whole zone without an AXFR.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — anonymous: **do** send with no credentials; **observe** whether the route is reachable pre-auth.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="dns-enum-test-wildcard-owner-name-must-be-subtracted-before-a-sweep-is-believed"></a>

## dns_enum.test.wildcard_owner_name_must_be_subtracted_before_a_sweep_is_believed

**Claim.** A wildcard DNS record synthesises an answer for every name under its owner, so a subdomain bruteforce returns a hit for every candidate and the wildcard payload must be probed and subtracted before any discovered hostname is believed.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Blind / out-of-band confirmation* — Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.

<a id="dns-enum-validation-serial-and-secondary-cross-check-confirms-a-real-disclosure"></a>

## dns_enum.validation.serial_and_secondary_cross_check_confirms_a_real_disclosure

**Claim.** A zone-transfer disclosure is validated only by showing a full multi-record answer whose SOA serial is current and whose names exceed the public NS/SOA/MX set, because an empty or serial-stale answer is a replica, not a disclosure.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.

<a id="dns-enum-validation-refused-zone-transfer-is-not-enumeration-evidence"></a>

## dns_enum.validation.refused_zone_transfer_is_not_enumeration_evidence

**Claim.** A refused DNS zone transfer proves the zone is not AXFR-open, not that no records were retrieved; enumeration evidence requires a returned record set from the transfer, an NSEC walk, or a secondary resolver.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — anonymous: **do** send with no credentials; **observe** whether the route is reachable pre-auth.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

<a id="dns-enum-technique-zone-transfer-enumerates-the-network"></a>

## dns_enum.technique.zone_transfer_enumerates_the_network

**Claim.** A DNS zone enumerates every host in a namespace without touching it, and an AXFR zone transfer returns the entire zone, so one query against a misconfigured server replaces host discovery.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

## dns_enum.technique.zone_transfer_or_a_misconfigured_dns_service_reveals_the_i

**Claim.** Zone transfer or a misconfigured DNS service reveals the internal host inventory that no port scan would expose.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

<a id="dns-enum-technique-ns-and-soa-records-bound-what-a-zone-transfer-can-add"></a>

## dns_enum.technique.ns_and_soa_records_bound_what_a_zone_transfer_can_add

**Claim.** The value of a zone transfer is proportional to what the zone's NS and SOA records already imply, so enumerate those records first to size the transfer, then use the transfer to recover only the names those records never exposed.

**Procedure — Blind / out-of-band confirmation** (shapes: blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.
2. Then test the vulnerable condition. Absence of a callback is only meaningful once the channel is proven.
3. Record the callback evidence (resolved host, token, timestamp) — a blind result with no artefact is not reportable.

**Record:** channel self-test, callback artefact, timing

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the header? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.
