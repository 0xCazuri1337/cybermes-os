## authz.test.a_response_that_differs_between_anonymous_and_au

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Discard the finding when the differential is confined to the shell: an anonymous call returns a login redirect, a 401, or an empty shell page, while the authenticated call returns the same resource you could already read as that user.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — anonymous: **do** send with no credentials; **observe** whether the route is reachable pre-auth.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="authz-test-bis-this-vulnerability-arises-when-an"></a>

## authz.test.bis_this_vulnerability_arises_when_an

**Claim.** A broken access control finding is only real when a request issued as an identity that holds no permission for the resource or action still succeeds, so identity substitution on an otherwise-valid request is the test that separates the finding from normal behaviour.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

<a id="authz-validation-authenticated-versus-authorized-must-be-proved-with-two-different-accounts"></a>

## authz.validation.authenticated_versus_authorized_must_be_proved_with_two_different_accounts

**Claim.** A 401 on an endpoint proves authentication is enforced and says nothing about authorization; the authorization question can only be answered by two accounts with different privileges and the same request.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — http2: **do** negotiate h2/h2c; **observe** frame-level parsing differences.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — cookie: **do** send it in a cookie; **observe** server-side cookie reconstruction.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — low_priv: **do** send as your lowest-privilege account; **observe** whether the response differs from anonymous.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the cookie? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

## authz.auto.t.c83c3273

**Claim.** Terminal server does not check authorization for guest access.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

## authz.auto.t.3360ff16

**Claim.** System monitoring software allows users to bypass authorization by creating custom forms.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

**Claim.** Public writeup evidence for authz: self-registration onto a data platform.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.

## authz.auto.t.271439a9

**Claim.** The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Procedure — Race / TOCTOU attempt** (shapes: race_condition; steps from template)

1. Identify the check and the use as TWO separate operations, and measure the gap between them.
2. Fire many parallel attempts (tens to hundreds) so at least one lands inside the window.
3. Vary ONLY the timing; the payload and session stay fixed.
4. Report a rate, not a single success: N successes in M attempts both proves the window and tells the reader whether it is practical to exploit.

**Record:** attempts, successes, success rate, window size if measurable

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.

**If the first attempt is flat**

## authz.auto.t.39d9c444

**Claim.** An attacker could read sensitive data, either by reading the data directly from a data store that is not restricted, or by accessing insufficiently-protected, privileged functionality to read the data.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, state_change; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.

## authz.bypass.a_secured_method_is_only_enforced_when_it_is_reached_through_the_proxy

**Claim.** Method-level authorization annotations are enforced by an interceptor around the bean, so an internal call path that reaches the annotated method without going through that bean - a self-invocation, a direct construction, a scheduled task, a deserialiser, or a second bean holding a reference - executes it completely unchecked.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.

- **What sits between client and sink?** — proxied: **do** request through the proxy/CDN; **observe** normalisation the proxy adds or strips.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat through the proxy? Compare against the ORIGIN directly if reachable — the difference is the proxy's contribution.
