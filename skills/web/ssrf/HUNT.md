# HUNT runbook — ssrf

**26 promoted technique/test/variant items**, each mapped to an executable procedure derived from the shape of the claim. Generated from `db/wks.db`; do not hand-edit (regenerate with `python tools/playbook.py ssrf web`).

Sources of steps: 0 item-authored, 26 template-derived (a template step is the SHAPE's procedure, not a claim-specific one — treat those as the starting point and adapt).

<a id="ssrf-validation-identify-which-component-parsed"></a>

## ssrf.validation.identify_which_component_parsed

**Claim.** A bypass is only proven when the component that actually performs the fetch resolved a different host than the validating component approved.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="ssrf-test-a-bypass-is-only-proven-when-the-component-that"></a>

## ssrf.test.a_bypass_is_only_proven_when_the_component_that

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: A payload rejected by a strict allowlist comparison is not a bypass even if a client would have parsed it differently.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="ssrf-technique-cloud-metadata-endpoints"></a>

## ssrf.technique.cloud_metadata_endpoints

**Claim.** Cloud instance metadata services are reachable at 169.254.169.254 and by vendor DNS name, unauthenticated by default, making them the primary SSRF target.

**Procedure — Blind / out-of-band confirmation** (shapes: blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.
2. Then test the vulnerable condition. Absence of a callback is only meaningful once the channel is proven.
3. Record the callback evidence (resolved host, token, timestamp) — a blind result with no artefact is not reportable.

**Record:** channel self-test, callback artefact, timing

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — anonymous: **do** send with no credentials; **observe** whether the route is reachable pre-auth.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="ssrf-technique-hth-the-attacker-can-supply-or-modify"></a>

## ssrf.technique.hth_the_attacker_can_supply_or_modify

**Claim.** The attacker action in an SSRF is supplying or modifying the URL that server-side code dereferences, which makes any parameter that changes the fetch destination the entry point to hunt for.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.

<a id="ssrf-technique-internal-loopback-trust-escalation"></a>

## ssrf.technique.internal_loopback_trust_escalation

**Claim.** SSRF impact is highest when the server is trusted by its own front-end controls, bypassing access control on loopback or private back-ends.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **AS whom are you testing?** — anonymous: **do** send with no credentials; **observe** whether the route is reachable pre-auth.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="ssrf-technique-url-parser-differential"></a>

## ssrf.technique.url_parser_differential

**Claim.** Allowlist validators and the back-end HTTP client parse URLs differently, so a URL the validator accepts can still resolve elsewhere.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, encoding_ladder; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHAT transformation sits between you and the sink?** — double: **do** send it percent-encoded twice; **observe** single-decode filters are bypassed.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — differential: **do** compare against a control that differs in one variable; **observe** the difference the control did not produce.

**If the first attempt is flat**

You are at the `double` rung. Continue the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Encoding / normalisation ladder* — Build the ladder BEFORE probing: raw, single-encoded, double-encoded, and over-long variants of the same logical value.

<a id="ssrf-technique-a-server-side-request-forgery-is-confirmed-when-a-url-supp"></a>

## ssrf.technique.a_server_side_request_forgery_is_confirmed_when_a_url_supp

**Claim.** A server-side request forgery is confirmed when a URL supplied by the client is fetched by the server and its response body is reflected back to the client.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.

<a id="ssrf-auto-01"></a>

## ssrf.auto.01

**Claim.** The given PHP code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it directly accepts a user-supplied URL from the $_GET['url'] parameter and fetches its content using file_get_contents(), without any validation or restrictions.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.

<a id="ssrf-test-a-payload-that-a-blocklist-rejects-and-which-pro"></a>

## ssrf.test.a_payload_that_a_blocklist_rejects_and_which_pro

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: A 4xx, a validation error, or a silent drop with no collaborator traffic is the expected outcome of working filtering.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.

<a id="ssrf-technique-ht-however-in-case-there-is-no-syste"></a>

## ssrf.technique.ht_however_in_case_there_is_no_syste

**Claim.** When a VM has several user-assigned managed identities and no system-assigned one, the metadata service errors out instead of issuing a token, so identity enumeration has to pivot to the platform configuration endpoint to learn which identities exist.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.

<a id="ssrf-signal-oast-unique-domain-callback"></a>

## ssrf.signal.oast_unique_domain_callback

**Claim.** A server-originated HTTP request to a unique domain you control is the definitive signal of blind SSRF.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

<a id="ssrf-test-a-confirmed-blind-ssrf-callback-proves-request-i"></a>

## ssrf.test.a_confirmed_blind_ssrf_callback_proves_request_i

**Claim.** To decide this case, observe: Without a readable response you cannot show what was retrieved, so keep the finding scoped to 'server makes attacker-directed requests' and state the unproven parts explicitly.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

<a id="ssrf-variant-ht-5-2-ssrf-to-rce-historical-6-3"></a>

## ssrf.variant.ht_5_2_ssrf_to_rce_historical_6_3

**Claim.** Where a request parameter takes an arbitrary URL, feeding it a loopback admin address and observing the server act on the fetched content is the test that turns that parameter into an SSRF sink and the entry point for escalation to code execution.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.

<a id="ssrf-technique-ht-this-setup-exposes-a-vulnerability"></a>

## ssrf.technique.ht_this_setup_exposes_a_vulnerability

**Claim.** A TLS ClientHello whose SNI carries the tester's target host steers the server-side connection, so a user-controlled SNI echoed verbatim from input is a probe for server-side request forgery.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.

<a id="ssrf-technique-ht-if-the-library-builds-the-request"></a>

## ssrf.technique.ht_if_the_library_builds_the_request

**Claim.** Newlines smuggled through a filename field can inject extra headers into the outbound request, which is how a cloud metadata service that demands specific headers is reached from a server-side request.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the header? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.

<a id="ssrf-technique-ht-1-confirm-blind-ssrf-with-oast-2"></a>

## ssrf.technique.ht_1_confirm_blind_ssrf_with_oast_2

**Claim.** Blind SSRF escalates to exfiltration without ever seeing the raw HTTP body by pointing the URL at a benign text endpoint and then looking for that fetched text reproduced inside the downstream artifact the tester can actually read.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat direct? Go through the real front door (proxy/CDN). Intermediaries normalise, and their normalisation is the behaviour you are hunting.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Blind / out-of-band confirmation* — Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.

<a id="ssrf-signal-ht-dns-failures-tls-validation-error"></a>

## ssrf.signal.ht_dns_failures_tls_validation_error

**Claim.** Errors that depart from the baseline of a well-formed URL - DNS failure, TLS validation error, 401 from a metadata service, scheme-parsing error - are usable as positive proof that a server-side outbound request was issued and reached internal-only destinations.

**Procedure — Blind / out-of-band confirmation** (shapes: blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.
2. Then test the vulnerable condition. Absence of a callback is only meaningful once the channel is proven.
3. Record the callback evidence (resolved host, token, timestamp) — a blind result with no artefact is not reportable.

**Record:** channel self-test, callback artefact, timing

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

<a id="ssrf-signal-hth-blind-ssrf-blind-ssrf-s-are-those"></a>

## ssrf.signal.hth_blind_ssrf_blind_ssrf_s_are_those

**Claim.** An SSRF whose response never returns the fetched content is blind, so the response body alone cannot confirm the server-side fetch and the finding has to rest on out-of-band evidence instead.

**Procedure — Blind / out-of-band confirmation** (shapes: blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.
2. Then test the vulnerable condition. Absence of a callback is only meaningful once the channel is proven.

<a id="ssrf-validation-dns-only-equals-egress-filter"></a>

## ssrf.validation.dns_only_equals_egress_filter

**Claim.** A DNS lookup with no follow-up HTTP request indicates the request was blocked by network filtering, not that the SSRF is a false positive.

**Procedure — Single-parameter differential probe** (shapes: http_param_probe, filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Record the BASELINE: request the endpoint with a benign, known-good value for the parameter. Save the full response (status, length, body hash).
2. Change exactly ONE variable: set the parameter to the attack value. Send it again with identical method, headers and cookies.
3. DIFF the two responses on all three axes: status code, body length, and body content hash.
4. Attribute every difference. A difference the control did not produce is the finding; a difference the control also produces is the application's normal behaviour.
5. Then re-run the attack value THREE times to separate a real condition from per-request noise (timing, nonce, ordering).

**Record:** baseline response hash, attack response hash, status delta, body-length delta, reproductions

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.

**Also applies — alternate procedures for this item**

- *Filesystem sink confirmation* — Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
- *Blind / out-of-band confirmation* — Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.

<a id="ssrf-bypass-dns-rebinding-defeats-a-check-made-once-before-the-request"></a>

## ssrf.bypass.dns_rebinding_defeats_a_check_made_once_before_the_request

**Claim.** An SSRF filter that resolves the hostname and checks the IP once, before connecting, is defeated by DNS rebinding, because the address the client connects to is resolved again and may differ.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
4. Confirm the bypass reaches the sink by observing an EFFECT, not by observing a different response status.

**Record:** plain value rejection, bypass variant that passed, observed effect at the sink

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

<a id="ssrf-technique-ht-tooling-aem-hacker-swiss-army"></a>

## ssrf.technique.ht_tooling_aem_hacker_swiss_army

**Claim.** Enumerate the whole parameter surface with an automated sweep rather than by hand, because a single enumeration script bundles SSRF detection together with dispatcher-bypass attempts, making untrusted-origin reachability the first property to establish on the target.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — container: **do** nest the value one layer deeper (archive, template, include); **observe** a second interpretation after the first check.

<a id="ssrf-variant-ht-even-if-one-remote-driver-only-sup"></a>

## ssrf.variant.ht_even_if_one_remote_driver_only_sup

**Claim.** Clearing one read-only callback handler does not clear the SSRF surface, because other registered backends in the same registry may still accept writes, so every registered handler has to be exercised before the feature is called safe.

**Procedure — Filesystem sink confirmation** (shapes: filesystem_sink, blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Prove the sink reads a file at all BEFORE testing traversal: fetch a file you KNOW exists on the target and confirm real content comes back.
2. If you cannot get a known-good read, there is no traversal finding to report — the sink is not proven.
3. Then apply the traversal value and confirm the returned content is from OUTSIDE the intended directory. Content, not status code.
4. Reject any result where only the status line differs: proxies, error handlers and WAFs produce status differentials with no file ever read.

**Record:** known-good read, outside-directory content sample, negative control (baseline vs traversal)

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — front_back: **do** front end filters, back end parses; **observe** a request the front end 'cleared' but the back end acted on.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — oob: **do** make the sink call back to a host you control; **observe** the callback, with timestamp and token.

<a id="ssrf-signal-hth-firefox-referrer-https-your-co"></a>

## ssrf.signal.hth_firefox_referrer_https_your_co

**Claim.** A referrer-analysing service on the target side records the Referer URL the browser sends, so a collaborator-domain URL appearing in a referrer log confirms that outbound traffic to a URL the attacker chose was generated.

**Procedure — Blind / out-of-band confirmation** (shapes: blind_confirmation; steps from template)

1. Establish that your out-of-band channel works AT ALL with a known true positive before drawing any conclusion from its absence.
2. Then test the vulnerable condition. Absence of a callback is only meaningful once the channel is proven.
3. Record the callback evidence (resolved host, token, timestamp) — a blind result with no artefact is not reportable.

<a id="ssrf-auto-02"></a>

## ssrf.auto.02

**Claim.** SSRF in LLM application development framework because the URL retriever allows connections to local addresses.

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.
3. Run it with a control that differs in exactly one variable.
4. If you cannot name the control, you cannot prove the claim — park it as unverified rather than reporting it.

**Record:** the discriminating request, control, observed result

**Vary these — each changes what you do and what you see**

- **Do two layers disagree about the same bytes?** — single: **do** one parser sees the request; **observe** a consistent rejection or acceptance.
- **What sits between client and sink?** — http2: **do** negotiate h2/h2c; **observe** frame-level parsing differences.
- **WHERE does the value arrive?** — header: **do** send it as a header; **observe** hop-by-hop stripping and header folding.
- **What PROVES it, beyond a status code?** — content: **do** obtain content from outside the intended scope; **observe** the returned bytes and where they came from.

**If the first attempt is flat**

No effect raw? Walk the encoding ladder: raw -> percent-encoded -> double-encoded -> look-alike separators, one rung at a time, never all at once.
Flat in the header? Move the SAME value to a different location (query / path / body / header / cookie). A filter on one location says nothing about the others.
Still flat? You have proven the sink is not reachable on this path, which is a RESULT. Record it and move to the next candidate rather than escalating payloads blindly.

<a id="ssrf-auto-03"></a>

## ssrf.auto.03

**Claim.** Chain: incorrect validation of intended decimal-based IP address format ( CWE-1286 ) enables parsing of octal or hexadecimal formats ( CWE-1389 ), allowing bypass of an SSRF protection mechanism ( CWE-918 ).

**Procedure — Claim verification (no mechanical template matched)** (shapes: fallback; steps from template)

1. Restate the claim as an assertion about observable behaviour.
2. Identify the ONE request that would be true if the claim holds and false if it does not.

## ssrf.validation.a_blocklist_of_resolved_addresses_is_not_the_same_as_an_address_space_check

**Claim.** A filter that rejects a named set of internal addresses is weaker than an address-space check, because every address belongs to one of three spaces and the classification is defined by what the address means rather than by its literal value.

**Procedure — Filter-bypass ladder** (shapes: filter_bypass; steps from template)

1. First establish what the filter rejects: send the plain attack value and record the rejection (status, message, silence).
2. Then vary ONE encoding dimension at a time: separators, case, trailing dots, alternate separators, redundant segments, container-level normalisation.
3. The first variation that passes identifies the filter's matching weakness precisely — which is the finding.
